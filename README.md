Handling strategy (imputation of average values-2.5)
Text Preprocessing (for Category)
Split column by delimiter (|) for proper categorization

**Data Analysis**
During analysis, some extra columns were created namely: 
Number of Reviews-formula: =LEN([@[review_id]])-LEN(SUBSTITUTE([@[review_id]],",",""))+1


Price Range-formula: =IF(E2<200,"<200",IF(E2<=500,"200-500",">500"))
Pivot tables were created with pivot charts and slicers utilized where necessary

**Recommendations**
Based on the EDA:
For Marketing Strategy:
Focus influencer campaigns on top-rated products
Provide discount as incentive for low performing categories such as Toys & Games
For Customer Engagement:
Address issues from negative reviews with auto-response and escalation.
Reward highly engaged customers who leave frequent reviews to encourage reviews on categories with fewer reviews namely: cars and motorbike, health and personal care, home improvement, office products, musical instruments, toys and games.
